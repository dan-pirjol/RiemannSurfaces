# RiemannSurfaces
**Mathematica visualisation of Riemann surfaces**

This repository describes a simple method for visualisation of Riemann surfaces in Mathematica using **ParametricPlot3D**. The method is illustrated on the Riemann surface of the inverse of $\sinh(z)/z$ which is described in Section 3 of [Nandori, Pirjol (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09412), also [published version](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377042721004404). 

The code plots the Riemann surface of $z(x)$ where $x = \frac{\sinh z}{z}$. More precisely, the code plots $Re(z^2)$ vs $(Re[x],Im[x])$. Denote $x=u+i v$.

The attached Mathematica code and the resulting evaluations are shown below. The plots take a large amount of memory (500MB) and GitHub does not allow such large files. Therefore I attach the plots as images below.
